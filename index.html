          <h2>What is a language?</h2>
          <p>
            A language is the principal method of human communication,
            consisting of words used in a structured and conventional way and
            <a href="#" data-text="to express a thought, feeling, or idea so that it is understood by other
            people. (e.g. With a single wag of her finger she managed to convey her
            total disapproval)." class="info-modal">conveyed</a> by speech, writing, or
            <a href="#" data-text="An action performed to convey one's feelings or intentions. (e.g. Maggie was
            touched by the kind gesture)." class="info-modal">gesture</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most crucial means of human communication is language. People
            can communicate with one another by speaking, writing, and gestures
            by using a set of words and sounds that are employed in a systematic
            manner. Language is the uniquely human ability to learn and use
            intricate networks of acoustic and kinesthetic signals to
            communicate ideas and emotions. Additionally, language is used to
            share information and experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Language systems on this planet differ significantly from place to
            region, which is an issue. A member from a different region or
            country may not be able to communicate with them because of the
            level of variety. To get over these challenges, individuals created
            lingua francas, or trade languages, which are used to communicate
            between speakers of various original tongues.

          <h2>Why to learn another language?</h2>
          <p>
            Since the world we live in is multilingual, relationships are more
            crucial than ever. The world is growing more and more international,
            therefore having second language skills might always be an unfair
            advantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your career may change dramatically if you learn a new language.
            Being a part of a globally linked society means that an increasing
            number of jobs are advertising positions where speaking more than
            one language is required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning another language opens up the opportunity for being part of
            a community with a different culture, and learning more about the
            world around us.

          Hi! My name is Oscar Romero, I am a Systems Engineer and an English
          teacher with 5 years of experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love sharing my knowledge, not only about the English language but also about
          things related to web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am terribly excited to share how important it is to know another
          language and the advantage you can have knowing more than one
          language, this can be applied to the Tech World, there are many
          programming languages you can learn and experience creating apps,
          websites etc.
